Real-Time ECG Signal Processing
This project captures real-time ECG signals using the AD8232 ECG sensor and processes them using the ADS1115 ADC, which is interfaced with a Raspberry Pi (or microcontroller). The data is collected, filtered, and displayed on a live plot using Matplotlib and Python.

Hardware Components:
AD8232 ECG Sensor: Measures ECG signals.
ADS1115 ADC: Converts analog ECG signals to digital.
Raspberry Pi / Microcontroller: Controls the system and processes the data.
Electrodes: Placed on the skin to capture ECG signals.
Jumper Wires & Breadboard: For connections.
Software:
Python: Code to interface with the hardware, process ECG data, and plot the real-time waveform.
Libraries: adafruit_ads1x15, numpy, matplotlib, scipy for signal processing.
Features:
Real-time Signal Capture: Captures ECG waveforms and visualizes them live.
Noise Reduction: Uses a low-pass filter to clean up the signal.
Customizable Parameters: Adjust sampling rate and filter settings for different applications.
Setup:
Connect the AD8232 sensor to the Raspberry Pi via the ADS1115.
Run the provided Python code.
View the ECG waveform in real-time.
Requirements:
Raspberry Pi or equivalent microcontroller.
Python environment with required libraries installed.
